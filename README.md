# 🩺 510(k) Submission Dry Run — Vitals Diagnostics Patch

This repository documents the **step-by-step preparation for a 510(k) submission** for the *Vitals Diagnostics Patch*, a non-contact wearable system for monitoring temperature, pulse, and respiratory dynamics.  
The goal is to build a **transparent, open educational example** of how a medical device submission is structured — while maintaining professional design controls and documentation discipline.
